A two layer artificial neural network is built and used to predict the correct identity of the characters in the
hafxy.pbm images. 
A sigmoid activation function is used. 
My program accepts one of the images in as a command line argument, and prints the predicted classification of the
image (H, A, F, X, or Y). 
Optimal weights are obtained by training the neural network and the weights are saved, which helps me in predicting the given letter of the image.
