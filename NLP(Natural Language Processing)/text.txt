If you, like myself, live in world where there is "weather", then you'll understand why I hate this product.  You see, there are times when the temperature of my car, and everything in it, becomes amazingly cold.  We call it "winter".  You've never heard of it, you say? Well, apparently neither have the people who dreamed up this stuff.  I've had a can of this in my car for over a year now.  Went out to my car one FREEZING morning (it gets like that during the "winter" I mentioned before), and saw I had a flat!  "No problem" thinks I, "I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!".  Open the trunk, pull out the "Fix a Flat" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money. If you live somewhere where there's actual WEATHER, don't kid yourself with this nonsense
